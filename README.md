# Forrest Jump

A simple 2D endless runner video game made with Unity. The goal is to jump those little forest devils and get the best score you can. This video game was made through a tutorial and reasonable modified afterwards.

## Getting Started

* Clone this project.
* Unzip Audio.zip in Assets/Audio folder to get all sound effects and then delete Audio.zip (this is given that Github could not upload .mp3 files properly, may change this later hopefully).
* Open it in Unity Editor (see Tools below for tested version).
* Build it to start playing.

You could also download uploaded Windows packages to install and play the game.

## Tools

These are the tools used for creating and building this project. Notice that all of them come together when installing a new Unity version from Unity Hub in Windows.

```
Unity Editor (2019.3.06f).
Unity Windows Build Support (IL2CPP).
Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Build Tools for C#.
```

## Gameplay Keys

* Space or Mouse Left Button (also A in Xbox 360/One Controller works properly) to Jump.
* P to open Pause Menu.

## Versioning

[Unity Collaborate](https://unity3d.com/unity/features/collaborate) was used for versioning.
